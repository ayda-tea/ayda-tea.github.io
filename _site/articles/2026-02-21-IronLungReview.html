<h1> So I Watched Iron Lung </h1>
<h3> 21/02/2026 </h3>

<p> I can’t believe this is going to be my first article on this blog. But hey. I guess the bloooge shall begin with blooode…

Coming into this review, I would like to clarify that I am a fan of the game but am also guilty of not having personally played it. If I do, I promise to write an addendum to this entry talking about my thoughts on it so this blog won't be forever stained by an admission of being a fake fan </3. Also, I have only viewed the movie once and have unfortunately missed certain parts of it during this viewing, as the audio filters applied to some of the dialogue really did not mesh well with my audio processing issues. That being said, here are my raw thoughts regarding the number one movie in America that one time:

Firstly, this movie takes way too long to establish a driving goal for the main character Simon. His only motivation for much of the movie is to “survive”, which might have been a fine enough goal for a horror protagonist normally but I think the simplicity of the plot requires more intrigue to keep the viewer engaged. For example, my interest was briefly piqued when Simon discovered the note left for him telling him to cross the wires, but I lost interest once more when we returned to the mundanity of him operating the sub. The movie’s attempt at slowly dripping in the tension through small “incidents” and its failure to engage the viewer with an actual coherent mystery ends up leaving the first half of the movie feeling like it lacks purpose and drags on.

Another thing is: This is not a movie that has like. Themes, in any substantial way. It just does not have much to say despite the premise of the film being one that would thrive if it utilized a metaphor or two. The titular Iron Lung limits the movie’s location so much that you’d think they would have realised that having something going on beneath the surface of the events would be a surefire way of making it more interesting to watch. If the movie does say anything, it’s about punishment, redemption and the devotion of oneself to a greater cause. This is the basis of the arc Simon experiences throughout the movie. However, I found that the movie failed to engage meaningfully with how this system of justice is so unnecessarily cruel and abusive to those who have defied them. Something something does punishment really achieve anything other than providing a sense of just satisfaction to those who perceive themselves to be in the moral “right”. Simon’s options were either capitol punishment or a highly probable chance of capitol punishment with a side of psychological torture, and from what he says in the movie these terms were not laid out clearly to him. The movie here had an opportunity to grapple with these injustices, but instead by showing Simon’s final choice to die for the cause it somewhat ties back to a “the ends justify the means” sort of philosophy. Like I get that they wanted to sell a redemption narrative but it feels a bit muddled to me, and not dealing with the societal implications of the situation felt like a missed opportunity.

The movie also occasionally plays around with the idea of belief, both in religion and in hope for the future, with new movie-only lore tidbits, but I will not dwell on these too much as many of my gaps in hearing relate to the segments where the Light was speaking to Simon. Buuuut I will say that I got the sense that these themes were thrown in for flavor and vibes rather than a thought out message.

Before the movie or even the trailer was released, I had two arguments for how this movie could be successful. A) They expand the lore and scope of the game so much that the movie ends up capturing a completely different type of horror than the game and succeeds in its own right, or B) They make it very experimental and eerie, similar to something like Skinamarink. I think they shot for both of these angles simultaneously, and ended up with an okay product.

Despite all my criticism, I still gave this movie a 3/5 star rating on letterboxd so obviously there were segments of this movie I really liked. So like, the directing was actually really good at times, right???? The thing is, I think the parts of this movie I especially enjoyed were due to my monkey brain response of “COOL HORROR THING!!!” so I will be articulating my positive thoughts about this movie in a much less formal and well thought out manner than my criticisms. 

Now I am not exactly what one might refer to as a “Cinephile”, but to my unrefined palette, I thought the shot compositions and editing of certain sequences were really wonderful, especially considering how small of an area they had to work with. My good friend Eren (hey girl!! <3) who actually knows about these things also agreed with me on the success of Mark’s direction. The segment where he takes the first photo of the creature’s face as we hear him drop the pen only for the camera to show him staring emptily into the black and white photo of this horrible thing really stood out to me for some reason. Maybe it’s cliche, but I appreciated the restraint they exhibited by showing us Simon’s reaction before we saw the creature itself. Mark was also not nearly as bad as I feared he’d be as an actor, because to be honest the trailers had not given me much hope. He’s actually really good at times, although he definitely isn’t perfect and I still think a stronger actor might have sold the part better. This is especially due to how huge of a role this is, with him being the only person on screen for 95% of the movie, but Eren also pointed out that part of the awkwardness I sensed was likely due to the script, and oof, I agree 100%. I do not always recognize shitty dialogue, but even I came out of the movie thinking “Hey, so, why did they say that.”

Good lord the practical effects were delightful. I loved seeing Mark climbing through all that goop. The MOMENT he pried open the floor panel to see the crawlspace leading to the engines, I knew he would have to crawl through that tunnel as it flooded with blood and the movie did NOT disappoint! Cave diving stays winning as the scariest thing a human being can experience! I also grinned in joy at the scene where the giant blood serpent and Simon locked eyes, and when the creature crunches the submarine at the end of the movie, both serving as absolutely bombastic releases of tension and moments of primal, cosmic fear.

Overall I think this movie has some quite low lows to the point that I understand people who hate it. I, being a fan of the game and an enjoyer of slow, hopeless cosmic horror, stuck with the movie and by the end was satisfied by some of the fantastic sequences they constructed. However, they are few and far between enough that I understood those who didn’t have the patience to get to those segments. My enjoyment of movies are usually colored more by the height of their heights instead of their lows but I understand that a few exciting scenes stitched together with a bit of a boring, confusing slog does not make a great movie. Still, I do not regret watching this movie one bit. And this would not be an Iron Lung review if I did not shout out shirtless Markiplier in a harness. God damn! *wolf whistles*
